# hello-world
A starter repository
I like coding. Ovibouisly. I also can't spell sometimes without spell check online. Obivously. I play CodeCombat. It's fun. I also write Wings Of Fire fanfiction. I'm reading Darkstalker, and even though I'm on, like page 3, I'm going to start Moon Rising. Yeah. Bye.
